//	HashSet is a set which has no duplicate elements and is a Hashing Table.
//	Unlike Linkedlist and Array List it takes O(1) time for insertion and deletion.
//	It has a loading factor which tells how much %age of space will be blank and it also boosts the insertion and deletion.
//	Default value of the loading factor is 0.75 but 0.5 is preffered.
//	In Hashset it is not necessary that the elements are arranged as per the insertion.
//	We must use HashSet because the Insertion and deletion is O(1) time only.
